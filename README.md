# Estimating the effective R0 for COVID19 in Germany

Estimation on federal state level. Work with https://github.com/hoehleatsu/.

## Description

The analysis is provided as a reproducible R-Markdown document, which produces a small [HTML report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/twentytitus/covid19-R0-germany/blob/master/R0.html) containing the analysis.

## Caveats

- Time series is by date of report at local level, not date of symptom onset (RKI data)

- Changes in the under-reporting of the disease, e.g. due to changes in the testing & reporting behaviour, influences the analysis

## Feedback 

... is much appreciated!
